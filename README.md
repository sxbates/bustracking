# bustracking
The objective of this project is to extract the location of a particular MBTA public bus from their live JSON data.  A map of the area using MapBox is provided and the bus' location is plotted on the map.  The bus' location is updated every 3 seconds.
Future improvements include adding multiple buses to the map.
